**No Connection** is a template for [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/) that works on
a local machine, without an html server. Visit us at Columbia's [Group for
Experimental Methods in the
Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/minimal-computing/no-connection.html) to learn more about our group.

## How to use
This Jekyll theme won't work on Github pages or on your local machine running a server. The _site folder it generates is meant to be used on a USB (or any other folder with a stable base url). To make it work for your USB you must set the baseurl on your _config.yml to reflect the name of your USB. In our case this is `file:///Volumes/no-connect.` Replace `no-connect` in our example with the name of your USB.
